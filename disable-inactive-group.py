Script to update 'groups.json' file

This script performs the following tasks:
1. Loads the 'groups.json' file.
2. Determines the previous year based on the current month:
   - If the current month is greater than 3, it uses the previous year.
   - Otherwise, it uses two years prior.
3. Counts and prints the number of enabled locations before any changes are made.
4. Checks each location in the JSON data to see if the 'lastscrape' date is in the calculated previous year and if 'enabled' is true.
5. Updates the 'enabled' field to false if the conditions are met and tracks the groups with changes.
6. Counts and prints the number of enabled locations after the changes are made.
7. Creates a backup of the original 'groups.json' file with the current date appended to the filename.
8. Saves the updated JSON data back to the original 'groups.json' file.
