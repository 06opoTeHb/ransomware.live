Those data includes patient&amp;#x27;s and employee&amp;#x27;s medical records, social security numbers, employees ID&amp;#x27;s, contracts, drug screens, payments and another sensitive info. In addition we have gained access to portals of federal medical regulation web-resources that allows managing of prescribed medicine and provides access to medical records of various individuals.  Top management of PainCare Specialists headed by president Poly Chen refused to contact us and protect data of their employees and patients, that decision violates their own policy which states that &amp;quot;Patients can expect that all communications and records about their care will be confidential, unless disclosure is allowed by law&amp;quot; We have faced complete indifference from Poly Chen, Yonguen Cho, David Keen, Donald Winder and other top management representative of this business. They are receiving and reading our messages but still refusing to answer.  That is why now everyone can see example of files stolen from PainCare Specialists which includes data supposed to be protected by Mr.Poly Chen and his team. In case if Mr.Chen and his team will not contact us until September  26th. All the data related to PainCare Specialists will be released for free.   Anyway we are giving another chance to PainCare Specialists to contact us until September 26th and protect data of their employees and patients</description><enclosure url="https://images.ransomware.live/screenshots/posts/a72c1db06c5d3771c935051f2f01623e.png" type="image/png" length="581928" /><guid>https://www.ransomware.live/#/group/alphv?2a93844ea798cbe1b9de3928a369e755</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 09:21:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Alphv has just published a new victim : TAOGLAS</title><link>https://www.ransomware.live/#/group/alphv</link><description>Taoglas is an enabler of digital transformation using IoT from initial strategy definition to design, build, deployment, and managed services.
