1. Drop executable to any folder.
2. Start new terminal session with administrator rights. (run cmd.exe or powershell.exe with admin rights)

OR

(!) IMPORTANT, READ ALL BEFORE DECRYPTION PROCESS
1. Yoy can decrypt only 1 folder (test decrypt for example)
decrypt.exe -forcepath c:\users\1\Desktop\folder
2. DO NOT CLOSE decryptor yourself
3. MAKE BACKUPS of important files what you will decrypt, then you can rerun decryptor if something happens
4. You can decrypt partially encrypted files:
4.1. Make backup
4.2. Add encrypted extension (random for every company, you can ask in chat) to file
4.3. Run decryptor to folder what contains file
4.4. Now you can test file
5. Every decryption process saves file in same location with name of decrypted file with extension .kbckp. In this file you can find individual chacha keys for better recovery experience.
6. You can ask in chat about ECC keys (used to encrypt chacha keys) for your company.
7. Make sure you have at least 10 gb of free space on each disk.
8. To choose folder on linux decrypt.linux -forcepath /path<br></br><i>23:44</i></p><p class="from-gang">Security report and recommendation:
