Also, they asked what is the method to pay you? Is it wire transfer? They will have a meeting tomorrow with the executives, so they are asking these questions. Thank you.<br></br><i>23:19</i></p><p class="from-gang">After deleting files, we will send you a full deletion log. As for the payment, - we accept the payment in cryptocurrency bitcoin.<br></br><i>03:24</i></p><p class="from-victim">Okay, thank you. They have another question about the payment. When you said $700,000, did you mean Canadian dollars?

We are now able to pay you $500,000 US dollars, but we have to pay a lot of money for the conversion from Canadian dollars to US dollars. We also checked on how to send the payment and we have to pay a large fee for sending the bitcoin.<br></br><i>00:34</i></p><p class="from-victim">Can you please accept the payment as $500,000 US dollars? That way, we still have some money to pay the fees for conversion and for the bitcoin? Thank you.<br></br><i>00:36</i></p><p class="from-victim">Also, if you accept this, please send us the wallet address for the bitcoin payment. We already have the company to send the payment but they asked us for the bitcoin address. Thank you.<br></br><i>01:52</i></p><p class="from-gang">OK, we agree. After payment:
