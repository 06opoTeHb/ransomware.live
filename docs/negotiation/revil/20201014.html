            <h1>💬 Negotiation with <a href="https://www.ransomware.live/#/group/revil">REvil</a></h1><BR><h2> ID: 20201014</h2><p class="comment">Date: 2020-10-14</p><div class="imessage"><p class="from-victim">Hello guys,
I am the person in charge to negotiate with you on behalf of my client. 
The amount of XMR requested to my client to get the decryption tool, the
 files back available and not published in the dark web (I have seen 
some exfiltrated data are published on your blog) is huge and my client 
cannot afford to fully pay your claims. My client is trying to cope with
 this difficult situation, since it has been heavily struck by the 
current economic crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic, with a dramatic
 fall of sales in the last months. My client’s net revenues amount to 
EUR 500.000,00 in the last financial statement (2.5 billion as gross 
revenues, which is a not relevant data if you guys are acquainted with 
economics). The financial situation of my client has been catastrophic 
since 2010, with a substantial decrease y/y in net revenues and gross 
operating profits. The cyberattack you have carried out on my client’s 
systems has blocked the company operation and all its internal 
operations have been shut down including deliveries, and as a 
consequence my client is not able to fulfil the market with its copper 
products and get revenues. My client has already had to make budget cuts
 and fire many of its employees or put them on unemployed insurance, 
with devastating effects on families and children amid the economic 
crisis due to Covid19. Therefore, it is impossible for my client to pay 
you 7.5 million USD. According to my client’s financial condition, I 
think he might be considering paying a certain amount in order to 
protect his business and to obtain the decrypting tool for all the files
 very quickly. However, such amount would be lower than the one you have
 requested, due to the heavy financial situation. In my personal 
opinion, my client has the financial availability to pay you 500.000 USD
 very quickly. A greater amount would be very difficult (almost 
impossible in my very personal opinion) to be paid because of the 
current financial situation. Let me know on this point.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Hello. We have deals with many companies every day, our pricing policy 
takes into account the Covid19 crisis. Do not take cover by this, the 
price is affordable for the company. 500k from a company like your is 
not seriously, of course we can give you a discount that will depend on 
the quickness of your payment, but price can't be too low as you ask 
for. We hid the post from our blog for the talks. if we will have a deal
 this information will not be ever published.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">What kind of discount are you guys thinking about? My client is really 
in a dire economic situation as previously said and I will try my best 
to convince him to add few money on the negotiation table. However 
adding money to his last offer would entail more budget cuts and firing 
more employees, leaving families without livelihood in this dramatic 
financial crisis.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You have no chances with $500,000 or this level of amounts of money, even don't try bluf by this.
If you pay shortly, we accept $6,75M.
If no, we start publication data part by part to speed up you.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">we are not bluffing and you do not know the financial situation of my 
client. However I will get back to you as soon as my client gives me a 
feedback on your so called "discount"<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">https://www.sendspace.com/file/[redacted]<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">[redacted]_Consolidated Financial Report 310320.pdf<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">if you cant find your insurance manual. Here is it.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Oh well, so you guys are familiar with economics. Are you sure you are 
able to read the numbers? My Client has been losing money since 2010. In
 the consolidated financial report you exfiltrated you can see that in 
the first three months of 2020 only the financial loss amounts to EUR 
[redacted] M. And take a look at the net financial position as at 31 March 
2020 which is negative by EUR [redacted] M. Moreover, look at bond trading 
level (30% yield) that my client needs to repay: 
[redacted]. The
 financial situation of my client is negative. I think you picked the 
wrong victim and the financial analysis you have performed prior to 
undertaking the hacking operations is absolutely wrong. Look at the 
chart herein attached and maybe you will be able to understand that 
economics is not hacking and my client is not Grubman nor Travelex nor 
Geox (the latter, just to remain in the [redacted] boundaries and a victim 
you may know).
With regard to the insurance manual you guys have exfiltrated please 
note that the insurance company Chubb does not cover the expenses 
related to a ransom payment but only the expenses my client is is facing
 for business interruption and recovery.
This being said, my client needs to resume normal operations as soon as 
possible minimising financial losses due to inactivity caused by your 
actions. So we need to find a trade-off between your requests and my 
client’s capability to pay. Too much money requested and really my 
client does not have that financial capability. My client understands 
your position and aspirations but can’t reach that amount. Overnight I 
convinced my client to add more money on the table. His offer now 
amounts to 750.000,00 but this will entail more sacrifices in terms of 
employment and debt repayment. People will be fired amid this financial 
crisis but I guess you guys don’t care about people left without 
livelihood.
If you guys don’t accept it, my client will set up the new 
infrastructure without data. It won’t be easy but my client is pretty 
sure to go back on the business within a few weeks. I mean my client is 
making the argument that the cost to restart the new infrastructure 
without data will not be higher than 700-800 k USD. That amount 
represents the break-event point for my client. If my client pays a 
dollar more, it won’t be convenient for him. So accept these 750 k USD 
or set a new affordable price or get nothing. If you accept or if you 
set a price which my client is able to meet, he will start the payment 
process as soon as possible, after finding a trusted exchange. 
Please stop the countdown as usual during the negotiations with your hacking group.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Good morning. Sorry, but your offer still isnt interesting for us. 
Companies with revenue like 10kk usually pays us this value. Comeback 
later when you will be able to pay more. We can wait but your client 
doesnt have enough time.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">If you think its easy to restore for 800k - go and do it. we dont care.
 first dump will be full of your client net passwords, [redacted] email 
dump, phone and password(that he use in many other services than your 
network). next will be with clients info, NDAs, payment infromation and 
technical specification of your production<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Do you mean if we do not strike a deal in 1 day 8 hours and 41 minutes you will double the price requested?<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">sure not<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">i added you 7 days.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Ok guys. What I am trying to let you understand is that my client is 
not in a good financial position and the financial statement you have 
had to chance to read clearly testifies what I am saying. The production
 plants are on hold and people are put on unemployed insurances and are 
being fired. I know that you guys don’t care because your goal is your 
personal profit. You carried out a perfect and clean job on my client’s 
network I have been told and you clearly deserve to be rewarded for your
 work. The issue is not if my client is willing to pay but how much 
money my client can afford to pay without worsening his financial 
condition and safeguarding jobs and families. This is the main issue. 
You guys are considering the data exfiltrated as valuable data that may 
cause a catastrophic reputational damage to my client if disclosed to 
the general public. Well, this is not the case. My client is not 
interested if you guys disclose [redacted] email dump or NDAs or whatever
 document you have in your hands. The value of the data you guys have 
stolen is irrelevant to my client. My client resells commodities ([redacted]) with a B2B model, there’s no industrial secret to be 
protected. And again, please believe me that I’m not bluffing on this 
point. You have read the documents you have stolen and you guys are 
experienced in the field: I bet you haven’t found any information worth 
USD 6.75 M. Any. So again, my client is interested in a quick restore of
 its network. Analysts have estimated that to restore the systems from 
scratch it will cost around EUR 800 k. Than there is the business 
interruption which is also covered by the insurance policy you have had 
the chance to read. If my client gets the decrypter, the network will be
 restored faster and the business will restart in a matter of days. 
Otherwise it will take longer but the costs incurred by my client will 
be integrally covered by the cybersecurity insurance policy.
This being said, we are at a negotiation table. Your demands (USD 6.75 
M) do not match our last offer (USD 750k ). We are way too far to reach 
an agreement. You guys say that our last offer do not you’re your 
expectations and to come back with a higher offer. But you guys have not
 lowered your request and showed any availability to reach an agreement 
and a win-win solution for both the parties involved. I mean, this is 
not a negotiation. Are you guys willing to get a reward for your team? 
What if I convince my client to put USD 1 M on the table? My client will
 never pay you the amount you have requested, but with some sacrifice he
 might be able to reach the USD 1 M threshold.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You write a lot of text but all of this doesnt matter. Why ? [redacted] is ONE
 of the WORLD's LARGEST manufacturers of [redacted]. Your 
client spent some millions on recovery software and hardware for it, but
 admins using passwords like "[weak password redacted]". But sure we cant take your 1M 
offer because this is ridiculous. We are thinking that you are bluffing 
and trying to make price so lower, but I understand it is just your job.
 You working fine, price updated to $5M<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">hey, guys, thank for lowering the price.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I mean that being one of the largest corporations does not imply to be the richest. This is the point<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">If my client had the financial resources you think the IT department would be stronger and [redacted] systems would be more secure<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted] IT department has proved to be very very little in terms of 
capacity and you guys have been good to leverage the vulnerabilities in 
[redacted] network. But this is not the point<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">You are sure that [redacted] has the financial capability to meet your 
demands. If you look at the reports as well as at the newspaper news you
 can easily see that [redacted] is in deep trouble.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">So I am not bluffing because I have been asked to keep the price as 
lower as possible. I am an experienced negotiator, I undertook many 
negotiations with REvil and I know how to talk with you guys. I know the
 threshold I can or I cannot exceed. This is not the case. My client has
 a very limited financial ability and I am not fooling you around<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">So please do reconsider your demands and go for a win-win solution as REvil usually pursue.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">If you have undertook many negotiations with REvil you have to know that much smaller companies pay more than your offer.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Well, it hasn't been my case fortunately! Yes, I confirm I have 
undertaken many negotiations with REvil affiliates and I have not bumped
 into a negotiation with a payment of more than 1 M. Two months ago a 
REvil affilate attacked a very famous italian company. The intial 
request was 7.5 M USD, with revenues like [redacted]. The deal was closed at 
USD 750 K. You can ask REvil affiliates if I am not speaking the truth.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Moreover [redacted] does not give a shit about the data you have stolen, so I 
have been told. So please reconsider you request and maybe we can find 
an agreement.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I think there were reasons for that, it is not for nothing that they 
reduce the price to 750k from 7.5m, you are too mistaken in thinking 
that the situation is the same here. I could cite cases when companies 
with ten times less revenue paid 3M, or paids 100k only for one personal
 computer, but it is not create rule, it is just an exception, 
exceptions only confirm the rule.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I can see your point and I get it. I think I am not mistaken and the 
situation is similar to the one I mentioned. I mean, the price paid 
depends on many factors: 1) financial availability 2) ability to restore
 the network without the decrypter 3) time necessary 4) consistency of 
backups 5) profit loss for buisness interruption and so on. What I am 
saying that this is the sixth time I bumped into REvil and my client has
 never paid more than 1 M USD. But maybe they are exceptions that 
confirm the rule.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Other Data Recovery Companies has never clients with paid more $5,000, 
but it is not means we will agree for $5,000 in case like this.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">The situation is the following: 1) [redacted] has a very limited financial 
availability. 2) [redacted] is already working on network restoring (costs will
 be covered by the insurance policy) 3)the time necessary to restore the
 network from scratch will be almost 12 days 4) there are backups 
available on LTO tapes 5) the profit loss for business interruption will
 be limited and covered by the insurance policy<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I get your point but [redacted] offered USD 1 M clean, not 5 k$.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">In view of this situation, $ 5M is reasonable.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted] does not have $ 5 M. I can try to convince the client to add more 
money, but there no cash flow to pay the amount you have requested.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Of course. Because $1M too low.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I know that the amount offered does not meet your expectations. What's a
 reasonable amount for you?Take into consideration what I have just told
 you in this talk<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Our offer $5M<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Waiting for your...<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Talk to the client and get back to you in a while<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">ok<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">good morning. do you have new information for us?<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Yes. Talked to the client and they shared that profit margins on 
revenue that is generated is tiny, and due to the lack of business 
having actual cash to turn into monero is hard to come by. They 
understand you ask more money, but they wanted me to let you know that 
they are having a hard time coming across more money. Now they have 
access to USD 1.27 M in cash, but it won't be available until Monday 
since they can't send money with the banks closed.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We have good news to you, price $2.5M for this deal. We prefer Monero, 
but provide you bitcoin payment method to make it easier for you. But 
there is a nuance, if you pay in bitcoins, the additional commission is 
10%.
After payment we will fulfill all agreements with decryption, will 
provide any supports, delete the data from our servers and will provide 
you short report on how you were hacked, keep in mind we still have 
access to the network and watching for any movements.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Refresh the page to see changes<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">hello. are we waiting for your payment today?<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Hi guys. Sorry for being late but my client took his time over the 
weekend to have internal meetings in order to respond to your last 
request. Notwithstanding my client has strived to find more budget to 
pay your claims, there is no more money available to be put on the 
table. The financial condition of my client is terribile and you know it
 and the economic situation of Italy has been catastrophic since a 
decade with impactson [redacted]. My client can't afford to take away anymore 
money from the budget needed to run the company operations and to pay 
employees salaries. It has been a difficult decision and my client is 
fully aware that this decision could stop the negotiation with you guys 
and that consequently he won't get the decrypter. However my client has 
reached the maximum cap and the costs he might face without the 
decrypter are, according to cybersecurity analysts and loss adjusters, 
close to $ 1 M. So this is it. Let me know.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">If I understand correctly, your last offer is $1.27M, if we will agree, how many time do you need to make the payment?<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Yes, correct. We will need about a day since buying Monero takes time, especially when we use a broker in the USA<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Okay guys so medium price between your offer and our waiting is 1.5kk. 
price updated for 48h and it is final call. Write a message when you 
will start exchange for lock xmr rate.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Client again took some time to think about to your last offer. Due to 
the fact that Monero has high transaction rates (around +10%), my client
 is willing to pay you 1.27 M within the next 48 hours. Client is not 
able to fully meet your demands as you know and understand. Let me know 
if this is ok for you and client starts the payment process.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">ok. price updated.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Please do confirm that the decrypter is general and works for each and every system you guys have encyrpted<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Yes. general decryptor works for all system that was affected<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">how much time do you need to make this payment?<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">hello?<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Be patient, we are working on it. Expect the payment very soon, a matter of hours.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Can you lock the Monero price for us? We are placing our order now.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Ok. Freezed<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Payment sent.<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Waiting for 10 confirmations by Monero network<br></br><i>1 month ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">To use a decryptor run it as administrator and turn off antivirus before.
You can use a decryptor as gui application or through cmd.

CMD commands:
dec.exe -full
dec.exe -path "C:\folder"
dec.exe -file "C:\folder\file.txt.random_ext"

* decryptor with -full option will decrypt all with default params.

If you use it as gui application, I recommend you choose "create 
backups" option. If you use decryptor without this option, you should 
not interrupt decryption process, otherwise some files will be 
irreversibly damaged.

How it works with "create backups" option:
1. Decryptor looking for encrypted file
2. creating backup of file
3. decrypting file
4. removing the backup
5. looking for a next file and loop repeating.

You can collect list of extensions, input to the textarea above the chat
 and click "Download" to generate General decryptor to decrypt files 
with these extensions.
But this way is not necessary, because we provide you the universal 
decryptor. It just works little slowest but you don't need collect 
anything, just download it and use on any system with admin rights,

 told me that in case of ransom payment you would have given my client a
 sort report on how my client was hacked. Can you please provide such 
short report? My client is very interested about it and I think that 
after the successful transaction he deserves to know the entry point and
 how you gained privileged access to the network. Thanks for
