executives to assist them in completing a business arrangement with you.
 I'm neither a technological expert nor a lawyer. I have a financial 
background and currently work in the public sector here in the [redacted]. As 
you probably understand, we would like to complete this unfortunate 
event as swift and clean as possible. Kindly let me know how should I 
call you and when should I expect your reply. Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Hello, our communication is conducted only through this chat.
We are ready to listen to your proposal.<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thank you Sir/Madam. I have no idea what kind of proposal I should make
 to you. We are an [redacted] charity run by [redacted]. We get money, 
public funds, and I have no experience in this occurrence. We are not a 
business. I understand that we need to pay a certain amount in order to 
get our systems back to full operation. Am I right? Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Yes, you are right, for our part we want to see the best deal that you can afford.<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir/Madam, do you mean what is the amount we can pay in order to restore our systems? Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir/Madam, do you mean what is the amount we can pay in order to restore our systems? Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Yes of course.<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sorry Sir/Madam, for sending twice. I'm a bit overwhelmed by stress and this experience.<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">No problem.<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir/Madam, I honestly don't know. I see that you request 4 Million USD 
which is almost 3M GBP. We will never be able to pay this amount. Should
 I now tell you how much we are willing to pay? Is this what you mean? 
My apologies to be very cautious. I don't want any mistake to happen 
here. It is the future of 50,000 pupils. Young kids. Respectfully, 
[redacted]<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We understand this, but still we do not expect a low offer from you.<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir/Madam, I understand. Please allow me to consult. Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We wait.<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We are not in the mood for a long conversation, so we look forward to hearing from you shortly.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir/Madam, I'm here and after intense conversations and internal 
consultations as you might imagine. Please refrain from hostile 
language. I will appreciate it. I was instruct to further elaborate with
 you couple of points, obviously after I did my own research about you 
and your highly professional capability and status.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Well, we are ready to listen to your questions.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thanks Sir/Madam. I appreciate that. (1) What type of information will 
you provide upon completing the deal? (2) What type of information are 
you currently possessing? (3) How can I guarantee that data will not be 
further monetized upon completion of our deal? Thanks much in advance. 
[redacted]<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We value our reputation and we have proved ourselves over a long period
 of time. We have a 100% guarantee after the transaction is completed 
that you will receive the decryptor and your data and information about 
you will be immediately deleted.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Also, after payment, we will conduct a full audit of your network in order to avoid subsequent hacks.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thanks Sir. I will convey this and revert shortly. Respectfully, Emilie<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thank you Sir. I believe that the last offer will not be required, 
however, I will be extremely thankful if you could at least tell me what
 information you have in your possession. I believe that this 
information is of utmost importance to determine the amount the charity 
will pay. Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, I could not red your last message. Was it deleted deliberately? Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">My apologies for typo. I meant "read".<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We have information about all your financial transactions, the details of your partners, card numbers and much more.
We never conduct a full check of the information we have.But for example
 : [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted]<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Sorry for the failed submission last time.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thank you Sir. I understand that. Mistakes happen at all times. We are 
all humans. I will forward your reply. What does this mean: 
[redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] Is this a
 file? or a directory? I want to ask you in order not to look 
unprofessional in the eyes of my colleagues. Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">These are lines from your documents.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, does it suppose to mean anything of importance? Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">If you think the card details of their owners are important, then yes, they are.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, you mean Credit Card details of the Charity owners? Is this what 
you have in your possession? I'm asking again in order not to cause any 
confusion, and the guarantee an decision making process which is based 
on accurate data. Thanks, [redacted]<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">No, I mean the credit card details of your clients or employees.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Ohh, I understand. Thank you. I'll revert, hopefully tonight. Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I hope you understand that this is just an example of what we have.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Yes Sir. I do understand. And I'm confident enough in your wisdom to 
present me with an attractive information, in order to present your most
 valuable assets. Credit card information of employees is probably the 
most attractive asset. Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I would like to remind you that we are not ready to drag out 
negotiations. In case of waiting for long answers, there can be no 
question of any discounts from our side.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, I'm aware of that. I will present a significant amount in my early
 AM tomorrow. The relevant decision makers are currently consulting. 
Thanks for your understanding. Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Good morning Sir.. Your TOR website is offline for quite some time now.
 Is it ok to continue using this platform? Respectfully. [redacted]<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I got the mandate to make you an offer. Please let me know if it's ok to make it now?<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Yes we are listening to you.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thanks Sir. We can pay 750,000 USD in XMR, provided that you will share
 with me the exact scope, volume, and significance of data that is in 
your possession. I would like to stress that this amount is far beyond 
what we understand is usually charged by your teams (based on recent 
news reports. I've turned to be an expert on your business in the last 3
 days, Fortunately or unfortunately.) I do stress the data, rather than 
the decryption key, since I learned about your very positive reputation 
in providing decryption keys. Looking forward hearing your thoughts. 
Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You are asking for a huge discount.
But my boss is ready to take a step forward.
Our offer $ 3kk.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sorry, you mean 3 Million USD?<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Yes that's right.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Oh God. No, this is so far of what we can pay. Please hold and I'll report to my colleagues and revert. Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, we will not be able to pay that amount. Please advise. Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">This amount was formed after a detailed audit of your company and it fully corresponds to your level and size of your company.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You can make another suggestion, and we will consider it, but we are not expect small money from you.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, thank you for this frank answer. Your "client", my colleagues, are
 not a company, and it seems that your reply is of a general nature. We 
are a charity fund, [redacted] non-profit, and our resources are all 
public resources. I will be able to come back to my colleagues, once you
 provided me with any information which will make them re-evaluate their
 decision. One of your colleagues, in a recent interview, said that you 
don't like to bargain. So please, I'll appreciate if you will find me as
 a genuine partner with whom you share information in order to craft a 
deal which works for both of us. Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Publication of your information will create damage much more valuable 
than our requirements. Think about it, you have the minimal price and we
 usually don't negotiate about it.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">If you pay soon, we are ready to make an additional discount.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thank you Sir. I appreciate your advise, however this can't be 
cosidered a valuable advise. I will need to understand the percularities
 of what you wrote above: (1) Publication of which information? (2) What
 do you mean soon? (even if we agree tomorrow, it will take 3-4 days of 
official approval and execution) and (3) what is the additional 
discount? Thank you for understanding, and I really grateful for your 
willingness to assist. Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We are talking about publishing information that we have downloaded. If
 you pay before Saturday, we will give an extra 20% discount.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, your proposal set the price tag for publishing unknown information
 on 2.4M USD. I see no scenario that the charity board and trustees will
 approve this by tomorrow, in order to be executed by Saturday. Sir, if 
you want to take advantage of my expreienced services in deal making you
 will have to allow me (1) details of information you have, as this and 
the decryption keys are the corner stone of any decision which will be 
taken, and (2) set a reasonable price for a non-profit charity around 
800-900K, to be paid at some point next week. I'll be here, throughout 
this process, to make sure that we are progressing as planned. 
Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I provide you additional proofs below and recommend you hurry up with decision, because payment procedure can takes time.
If you don't pay, your files will be published to the blog and shared to
 media, other data will be sold. Anyway it will influence to your 
reputation, think about your customers and fines and other troubles 
waiting for you. We offer you solution to avoid everything of this.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">This is an example of files that we downloaded. All files you will receive after payment.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Good morning Sir. My sincere apologies for not replying last night. I 
was cought up at another event. I will forward this information to the 
relevant people and contact you back later during the day. I thank you 
for all the assistnce you provide in order to terminate this unpleasent 
affair. Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Hello, ok.<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, are you one person or few people rotating in shifts. Asking 
because you are always available, and always accesible. And are you the 
one who can finalize a deal or you need any approval from higher level? 
Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I have a boss<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thanks. Ok. I working on our case in the next couple of hours. Will revert as soon as I have information. Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Okay we wait.<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, one of the trustees of the charity have asked me in private what 
are the chances of bringing the price down to 900K USD? He shared with 
me her internal conversations and her belief, like you and me, that a 
deal is better than any publication. However, she said, reviewing the 
information you sent will not convice the relevant people to pay that 
amount of many. It's about "risk management" she said. Decryption keys 
and that information should cost around 1M. What would be your answer to
 her? Please keep in mind that she is sharing her thoughts with me in 
private and I'm not that sure that she represents any majority. Please 
consult with the boss and let me know? Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I'll be back to this computer in 2-3 hours, Sir. Thanks. [redacted]<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We need to discuss this with the superiors.Wait for answer.<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">My boss is ready to give you a discount.
$ 1.5 million is our latest offer.<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Let me remind you that this offer is valid only in case of quick payment.<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, I'm thrilled. Thanks a lot. I'll convey this in my meeting with 
board and trustees in the morning. First time in last days that I'm 
going to bed with a smile. I'll contact you for further communication 
and updates in the morning. Best regards, [redacted]<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We wait.<br></br><i>11 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Good morning Sir. Board and trustees of the charity will convene in 1.5
 hours. I'm in direct contact, as I shared with you yesterday with one 
of the trustees, and she will update me immedietly after the meeting, 
even before the official statement. Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Okay.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We wait.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, may I ask you a direct question? It's important that you will be 
completely honest with me, and if you don't know the answer, I would 
appreciate if you could check with the boss. Are you still interfering 
with our systems? Do you do any actions related to our employees? 
Awaiting your answer, [redacted]<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We provide this information only after payment along with the audit of your network.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I remind you once again that all our agreements are valid only in case 
of quick payment. It seems to us that you are deliberately delaying the 
dialogue.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, I wish I could have brought you into the trustees meeting. In the 
middle of meeting when they discuss paying your suggested price, came 
this notice of your continued efforts to sabotage the charity network. 
With all due respect, Sir, do you think it was necessary? Do you think 
it was helpful? I'm doing a tremendous effort to show everyone your 
nice, welcoming and human face, and you keep on your evil moves? How 
should I show my face now? I guess that you haven't understood that you 
and me are working together to bring this deal? You have to assist me, 
not work against me..!<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We never commit malicious acts while communicating.
These words are confirmed by our reputation.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Are you completely confident about that Sir? I'ts not only your reputation here, it's mine as well. Thanks, [redacted]<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We are sure.
You have nothing to worry about.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Ok. I trust on that. I'll further communicate tonight. I need to go 
back, with this information, to do some damage control, and it starts to
 be late into the weekend. I'll come back later this evening. 
Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Today we are waiting for the results of your negotiations from you.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Good evening Sir, as I predicted on Wednesday or Thursday (sorry, last 
week was like crazy hell for me, very little sleep, very stressful, and 
almost no time for my young kids), the charity's leaderhip could not 
make a decision before the weekend. As predicted they asked me to ask 
you to delay reply until after the weekend (Monday afternoon), as well 
as to seek, if possible, additional discount to 1M. I told them, 
bluntly, that I'm not sure about additional discount, becasue from what I
 understood from you, what your boss already approved was beyond the 
ususal discount you give. I left board meeting really frustrated, first 
of all on a personal level, due to the fact that I thought I will have a
 quite weekend, handing over our correspondance to the person who will 
take care of execution and buying the XMR, but also because I have no 
face to disspoint you. I know that you expect an answer, and I feel bad 
that I can't deliver any positive results at the moment. I need to ask 
you for an extension. I'll be here to reply to all your notes, to 
provide you with any background information you need, and even if you 
want to exchange weekend receipies. Board and trustees will reconvene 
after the weekend, on Monday morning, and on the positive side, it gives
 me time to talk and to be successful in persuading them to complete the
 deal in order to recover all systems by Tuesady/Wednesdy. Thanks in 
advance for you understandging. I really appreciate it. Respectfully, 
[redacted].<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We have provided the maximum possible discount in your case.
On Monday night, we will no longer be able to talk about any concessions, as the ransom amount will double.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thank a lot, Sir, for understanding. I will be in close touch also 
during the weekend. Best and have good night. Tell your boss that you 
deserve some time off and a good drink. Emilie<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Please also update the countdown of the clock at the bottom of our corresponding page? Thanks, Emilie.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Your time runs exactly to the one indicated by me above.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Ok, maybe I'm a bit confused. I trust you. Good night Sir.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Okay.<br></br><i>10 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Good evening Sir. I hope that you took some time off to be with your 
family. I'm here to answer any question. Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Good evening Sir. The IT team have sent me a file, which they kindly 
ask you to decrypt in order to see, as mentioned in your early note and 
here on this website, the the decryption tool actually work. I will try 
to attach it now. Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>8 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Hello<br></br><i>8 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Good morning Sir, I could not sleep the whole night. Thanks for the file, I'll be in touch later this morning. Thanks, [redacted].<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">This was written couple of hours ago, but apparently there was a fault in your system and it was sent just now.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Okay , we wait.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thanks, I'm here. I would like to ask you, first, informally (before I 
speak to "my" trustee in the board). Is there any chance that you will 
be able to extend the deadline for Wednesday evening? The reason I'm 
asking is because there was some government move to our senior 
leadership, and I'm afraid that they were asked not to pay. I can tell 
you that the majority of board members want to complete the deal, as 
it's the only way they can restore the system, but it seems that the 
weekend brought with it also pressure in the opposite direction. Would 
love to hear your boss opinion on that. Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We are not ready to stretch the time like that.
All my boss is willing to offer is Tuesday night, if payment is received by then.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">If your senior management is unwilling to pay, we will start publishing information, be sure to remind them of this.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">This is why I'm checking with you Sir. The board of the charity is 
meeting in 1:30 hours, (2 PM GMT), and I want to bring them the most 
updated information from you. At the moment, you were kindly offering 
the charity to pay 1.5M and deadline is tonight. If I could get an extra
 "stretch" (as you wrote) to pay 1M, and deadline is Wednesday morning, 
that would have been very helpful to get the board and trustees 
approval, despite any other external voices. Please bring it to the boss
 approval. Anything of this will make my mission more likely to succeed.
 Thanks in advance, [redacted].<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We have already given you time to discuss these issues at your meeting today.
My boss isn't ready to give you time until Wednesday.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I understand. May I speak with the boss? Can he come to the chat? Can I give him an email address?<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">All conversations are conducted through this chat, and all messages are sent to it.
We gave you a good discount and enough time to resolve internal issues. It's all.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Please, you can't leave me with this answer. I see that boss can't do 
Wednesday, and I understand his and your perspective. Will it be 
possible to leave price as it is, and give time decision time until 
Tuesday night? If it was not this external inputs, I'm confident that I 
could have sort it out by myself. Thanks, [redacted]<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Please reply Sir, I'll be back in an hour. Need to go and prepare for board meeting. A women, you know.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Our agreement is valid until Monday night, I have nothing more to add for you.
The discount is provided for quick payment.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I see, Sir. I can't ask more, and I don't beg. If you can extend the 
deadline until Tuesday - it will be helpful with the board in 5 minuets.
 If you are not interested - I will not be happy with it, as it will be 
more difficult for me to persuade board and trustees to complete the 
deal, but - I will understand. As said, I'm a woman who respects herself
 and her partners. I will not beg. Respectfully, [redacted]<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">An article in our blog will be prepared tonight (not published at the moment).
Perhaps this way your bosses will want to pay faster.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">My boss is willing to allow until Wednesday, but in this case, discounts are out of the question.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">So Sir, what are my option, currently??<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">My options, I mean. 
1.5M until tonight or 2.4M until Wednesday? 
Or can you do 1.5M until Tuesday 2PM GMT? 
Best, Emilie<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">This is the last thing we can offer on Tuesday, 14:00 GMT.
If you do not pay, the data will start to be published.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thanks Sir. I appreciate it. A lot. Please convey my thanks to your boss. Respectfully, Emilie.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We wait.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">http://dnpscnbaix6nkwvystl3yxglz7nteicqrou3t75tpcc5532cztc46qyd.onion/posts/[redacted]?s=[redacted]

This is just a small part of what is being prepared for publication.
At the moment, this blog is only visible to you.
We hope your boss is ready to resolve this issue soon.<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Good morning, Sir. I see. Thanks for sharing. I'll revert soon. Emilie<br></br><i>7 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You don't have much time.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I know Sir. I can't ask for more time. There is no decision yet, on 
behalf of the board and the trustees. The situation has turned to be too
 complex, and I hope that a positive decision will be taken in the next 
couple of hours. I predicted that, and this is the reason for asking for
 the Wednesday deadline, however I fully understand your view point. 
I'll come back once I have news. Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We wait.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Today we have not received a clear answer from you.
Your data will be ready for publication shortly.
We still suggest that you solve this problem.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, I have no news. I wish I could solve this matter. I wish. I 
predicted the dynamics in the charity, this is why I asked for 
Wednesday, and 1M. There is nothing I can do now, apart from praying 
that your boss will give me more time. But if it puts you, personally, 
at risk, please don't ask. Yours, [redacted].<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">My boss is asking you a specific question.
Are you ready to pay on Wednesday or continue unnecessary conversations with us?<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, I want to be honest. I don't know now. I just don't know what the 
decision will be. They are discussing, elaborating, trying to find 
understanding and sources of fund to pay. It is completely your decision
 Sir. I can't ask for more. You were very generous, and I hope one day 
will come I could reciprocate. [redacted].<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We think it's worth starting publishing to make your bosses more accommodating.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">As said, it's your call. You are more experienced than me in this 
business, and I'm familiar with the decision making process here. 
Publication will most likely discourage charity's leadership to pay 
anything. But again, you have the finger on the control button. Hope 
you'll take the right one. [redacted].<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">What time is your meeting tomorrow?<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Starts at 14:00 London time. Sir.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">How long will they take?<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Hope to have an answer by 17:00 GMT. If not a definitive answer, at least a positive indication, Sir.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">What do you mean by "positive indication" ? Another meeting on Thursday ? Or preparing for payment ?<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I guess the latter Sir. This will not be dragged by Thursday, I believe.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Wait for answer.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Im here Sir. Waiting for you.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I'll check your decision in couple of hours Sir. I must leave this computer and go home to my family. Respectfully, [redacted].<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We spoke with the boss for a long time about the current situation.
If we receive the same response tomorrow as today, the attacks on your 
network will continue and the data will begin to be published.
That's all we have to offer at the moment.
Also, in addition to the time, we extend the amount agreed by us.We need
 to know if you have informed your management about the current 
publication?<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Time added. Price update.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, I thank you and your boss, however I'm a bit confused by your 
message. First, my colleagues are informed on all our communication. I 
understand about the publication, and the sample publication you sent me
 earlier is what stirred the debate among the trustees, as I predicted. 
Second, what do you mean the attack will continue? Is this kind of a 
terminology you use to persuade people? Thanks for understanding, [redacted].<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Continued attacks only in case of refusal to pay, of course.
If we find a common language, we can help you close all vulnerabilities and prevent future hacks.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">So, am I right to understand that you still have assets and access to 
the network? If yes, I need to inform the leadership as this change 
their discussions tomorrow. What type of access you have? Thanks, 
[redacted].<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Such information is provided only after payment.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Yes. I thought that this will be your answer. I'm too exhausted to comment. Thanks and have a good night. [redacted].<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We wait.<br></br><i>6 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Any news ?<br></br><i>5 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Sir, good evening. No news. Significant and powerful external forces 
are involved at the moment. No decision has been made. I don't know to 
say when. I'm asking for nothing. Just humbly informing you of the 
current state of affairs. Sorry for that. [redacted].<br></br><i>5 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">It seems like it's just your choice.<br></br><i>5 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Not mine, Sir. I'm doing my best. [redacted].<br></br><i>5 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">If during the day my boss does not receive a response from you, attacks
 on your network will continue, I hope your management will be 
pleasantly surprised.<br></br><i>5 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I will pass this message Sir.<br></br><i>5 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Why did you make your suggestions before, but now you cannot understand what is happening ?<br></br><i>5 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">After this timer expires, the data will be published in the blog and transmitted to the media.
