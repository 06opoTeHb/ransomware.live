            <h1>💬 Negotiation with <a href="https://www.ransomware.live/#/group/revil">REvil</a></h1><BR><h2> ID: 20210603</h2><p class="comment">Date: 2021-06-03</p><div class="imessage"><p class="from-gang">We are REvil Group.
We want to inform that your company local network have been hacked and encrypted. We have all your local network data. The Price to unlock is $2,500,000. Now we're keeping it a secret, but if you do not reply us within 7 days it will be posted on our news-site. Think about the financial damage to your stock price from this publication. In case of successful negotiations we guarantee that you will get decryptors for all your machines, non recoverable removal of downloaded data and security report on how you were hacked to fix your vulnerabilities. We hope that you can correctly assess the risks for your company.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Hello REvil Team - We are IT team helping client with the discussions with you and recovering. We would like to discuss how to proceed with this situation and reach a mutual agreement. For us the value of data is certainly very important. Can you provide us with some files your operative acquired from systems. I would suggest 5 files, from 5 different systems, you can choose. If you prefer to provide a file-tree of the files you have it would help us to work with the client to assess the appropriate value. 

We also have a few logistical issues we need your help with:

1. Payment will need to in BTC, XMR is not possible on this situation
2. Please provide an extra 48 hours to the clock. This is a long weekend and time will run out on Monday, but all banks are closed on Monday and closed on weekend. So we would appreciate the extra time so we can reach an understanding. 

Thank you, looking forward to working with you again.<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You can use Bitcoin instead of Monero, but it will be more expensive for you in case of our merchant additional fee,
so if u want to pay in BTC u need to add +10%. Btc enabled<br></br><i>14 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">It will take us a little time to collect the necessary data.

We are checking<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Hello - Our client has reviewed the data you provided. Based on available funds our client is in a position to offer $192,580 to have the assurance that the data is deleted. The client is already in the process of notifying clients of the situation. I would like to recommend that the offer is accepted soonest. Much graciousness.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Hi, all my boss has to offer is a 10% discount.
We know the scale of this company's problems.
Such low amounts are not even considered<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">To solve your problem, you need to increase your offer by at least 10-fold.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Good morning - I understand you offer a 10% discount. Can you please discuss with your boss, the situation is not urgent, nor does the client require decryptors. We work with you in the past on many cases, this is not a matter where such high amount will work to benefit. $192,580 is a lot of money in this case but I spoke to the client and they were able after a lot of accounting investigation to increase the amount to $237,290. Since we are coming to weekend, in many places this is a long weekend and the response will be delay. I recommend if you can speak to boss to try and close as soon as possible.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">My boss is not interested in this amount.
You have a few days before publishing in the blog and in the media<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">your boss is not interested in $237,290. We understand, it is your decision.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Friend, you shouldn't start this game, we know very well how much damage has been done to your client.
If it was insignificant, you would not write here.
If you have nothing more to offer, we have nothing to talk about<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">No games. Like I said, client is back to operations and no decryptors are needed. I am being upfront in terms of numbers. They cannot pay 10x of initial offer.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Not interested in wasting your time or mine.<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">As we said earlier. Your proposal is not interesting<br></br><i>12 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">It took me over 2 days to convince the client to come back to the discussion. What can you do to get to a more reasonable number? Decryptors are not needed.<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">It doesn't matter for us whether you need decoders or not, for us this is not an argument, one way or another you will get them<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">ok<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We have voiced our proposal to you earlier if you cannot approach it then there is no point in continuing the dialogue<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">sounds like you do not really want to discuss, I will update the client. Client will not pay what you are asking. 10% is nothing.<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We are ready to consider the issue of the discount again, but what you are offering sounds silly.<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">The client is an appliance retailer. they will use the money in a different way to protect employees so unless I get a more serious discount. otherwise you are right, this is not going anywhere.<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I have nothing more to add data will be sold and you must understand this<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">here is what you need to understand. No one will buy this info. You publish anything and we are done with this dance. The number you provided is not happening go back and get a better number that the client will consider or we are going nowhere. I am trying to tell you that they are willing to pay something, but your demand of 2.7mil after btc conversion is not worth the data you have.<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">If this data is useless, what are you doing here? If you have nothing to pay so much for, then why are you discussing the price?
Either make an offer that will interest my boss, or the publication will be in 19 hours and the "dancing" will end.<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I gave you an offer on the table which you choose to ignore and state its not interesting. Value is that you do not play silly games with your publishing, trying to protect employees. Anything else is meaningless. I can try to push to 350k.<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Not interested<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">ok<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">if your boss or you change your mind my email is: [redacted]@mail.com<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You shouldn't use the old tricks.
Leave your email with you<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Had a final discussion with management, final price is 400k. Your answer?<br></br><i>9 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I must say right away that the amount is less than 1kk my boss is not interested<br></br><i>8 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">If you agree, we close the publication and continue cooperation if not. I think you yourself know<br></br><i>8 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Like I said, 400k is last amount. Publication is now 0$. I tried to explain to you how things are, but you decide you know better. Too bad.<br></br><i>8 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Okay my boss agree price update you can pay.<br></br><i>8 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">ok hold on I need to bring client back.<br></br><i>8 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Ok we confirm the bitcoin amount to settle the situation. Thanks for updating price on site. We are working with a broker to get the bitcoins and do transfer within 24 hours.<br></br><i>8 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">ok<br></br><i>8 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Please confirm you will provide after payment:

For a decryptor, the payment will be much higher.<br></br><i>8 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">OK, understood.

Publishing all remote blogs and spreading information in the media that your companies (victims) paid us a ransom.
Don't consider yourself an almighty friend.
A new hacker worked with your case, who foolishly deleted the data after payment. This will no longer be the case, and rest assured that we do not store the data of the victims you paid for.
