For now you have to know that dealing with us is the best possible way to settle this quick and cheap. Keep in touch and be patient with us. We will reach out to you soon.

Please be in touch.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> list.zip // 2.84 MB<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> These files were taken from your network prior to encryption. You can pick 2-3 random files from the list and we will upload them to this chat as a proof of possession. To prove that we can properly decrypt your data you can upload 2-3 encrypted files to our chat and we will upload decrypted copies back. We're looking through your financial papers to come up with a reasonable demand to you. We offer: 1) full decryption assistance;
2) evidence of data removal;
3) security report on vulnerabilities we found;
4) guarantees not to publish or sell your data;
5) guarantees not to attack you in the future. Let me know whether you're interested in a whole deal or in parts. This will affect the final price.
If we don't get a respond within next 24 hours, we will be forced to announce your corporate data leak on our blog.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> I have downloaded the file list and will review it with the team<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> Meanwhile, we will come up with a fair demand to you.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> So, we've gone through your files to define your financial abilities. We've been looking through your bank statements, net income, cyber liability limits, financial audits - all the info that might help us to calculate our demand to you. We're willing to set a $165,000 price for ALL the services we offer:

1) full decryption assistance;
2) evidence of data removal;
3) security report on vulnerabilities we found;
4) guarantees not to publish or sell your data;
5) guarantees not to attack you in the future.

Let me know whether you're interested in a whole deal or in parts. This will affect the final price.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> Thanks for the detail.

Spending weeks inside of your network we've managed to detect some fails we highly recommend to eliminate: 1. None of your employees should open suspicious emails, suspicious links or download any files, much less run them on their computer.
2. Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.
3. Install 2FA wherever possible.
4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.
5. Update all software versions.
6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.
7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.
8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.
9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions. The most vulnerable point is the human factor and the irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc. We wish you safety, calmness and lots of benefits in the future. Thank you for working with us and your careful attitude to your security. The deletion log is coming later.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> Thanks for this  I'll check in later for deletion proof<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> Sure. We will upload it soon.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> Hey  Its been several days since we made payment, can we get this completed today?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> Hello. I think we can. I'll try to provide you with the log within a few hours.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> ok ty<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> log_erase.7z // 327 KB<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> Here it is finally!<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> thanks<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> You're welcome.<br></br><i></i></p>
