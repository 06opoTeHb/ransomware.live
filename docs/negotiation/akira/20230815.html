We have approval to pay you $800k tomorrow for decryptors, proof of data deletion, and security audit report. Leaking our name will make our ability to pay much harder. Please accept so we can put this behind us.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> We appreciate this offer but all we can do is to give you 20% discount in such circumstances.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> I have very good news. I was talking to the upper management and they are willing to accept $1,4M today for all the outlined options. On Monday we will have to return to our previous demand. Do we have a deal now?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> So, I passed your request regarding those files to the tech department. After decryption these same files were increased in size and then re-encrypted. After decryption, the files remained the same size, which means that our decryptor absolutely works correctly. It also means that you tried to play unfairly and gain more time. We also doubt your stories about "good backups". 

Based on all of the above, our offer of $1.4 million when paid today still stands, but we will not accept anything below $2 million on Monday. If you refuse and break the deal, we will simply publish your stuff and forget about you.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> Thank you so much for working with us. In good faith we are going to reveal to you that we only have $1,000,000 to work with. We can pay you all of that today. To get any more will be very hard and take many more days. Please accept $1 million and we will get that to you today<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> Please wait.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> Ok, the leadership has approved that number.

They say a couple hours<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> Ok, standing by.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> To confirm we pay you $1,000,000, and you will deliver whole network decryptors for linux, and windows, promise to not publish or sell our data, provide proof of deletion, and a security audit report?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> We do confirm the terms.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> and guarantees not to attack us in the future<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> Sure.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> thank you. sending bitcoin shortly<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">> Standing by.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> We just sent a test transaction.

Then kerberoasting was carried out and we got passwords hashes. Then we just bruted these and got domain admin password. Spending weeks inside of your network we've managed to detect some fails we highly recommend to eliminate:

1. None of your employees should open suspicious emails, suspicious links or download any files, much less run them on their computer.
2. Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.
3. Install 2FA wherever possible.
4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.
5. Update all software versions.
6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.
7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.
8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.
9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions. The most vulnerable point is the human factor and the irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc.

We wish you safety, calmness and lots of benefits in the future. Thank you for working with us and your careful attitude to your security. The evidence of data removal will be provided soon.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">> Thank you.
