I just use [redacted-software-vendor] point of sale to run my small bed and breakfast.  I see there is previous chats here with people also using [redacted-software-vendor] software.

We also only use [redacted-software-vendor]'s "Reservation" and "Point of Sale" system like the other poor souls above. We are all trying to make a decent living after Covid struck, and we in the hospitality sector suffered the most without being able to trade fully for 12-18 months. So with hardly being able to pay our staff where do you think we will be able to get US Dollars to pay you? Our US exchange rate is currently [redacted-currency] to 1$. You should hack the [redacted-location] government because they will be the only ones who can afford to pay you in US$... So please be reasonable and hack the big guys in the future not us on the ground trying to make a living. [redacted] Thanks and awaiting your reply...<br></br><i>21 December 2021 10:26</i></p><p class="from-gang">Obviously you don't know that our goal is not you, our goal is [redacted-software-vendor] which has the profits to cover all recovery costs.
