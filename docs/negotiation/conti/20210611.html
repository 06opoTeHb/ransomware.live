The recovery price is $600000 (15 BTC). If you want to make sure we can recover all of your data - you can send us the two files of your choice and we will decrypt them free of charge.
If we reach mutual agreement your will be provided with decryption tool, none of your internal data will be published and you will be provided with security tips on how to avoid further breaches.
We strongly recommend to review our offer in a timely manner to avoid additional expenses from your side on security software and on building the new network from scratch.<br></br><i>14/06/2021, 13:29:23</i></p><p class="from-victim">How do I know you can decrypt my data?<br></br><i>15/06/2021, 11:44:47</i></p><p class="from-gang">Send us your two encrypted files, and we'll decrypt them for you as proof.<br></br><i>15/06/2021, 14:56:40</i></p><p class="from-victim">nopdf.csv.[redacted] [ 76kB ]<br></br><i>15/06/2021, 21:08:08</i></p><p class="from-victim">esign_scripts-withTransID.sql.[redacted] [ 2kB ]<br></br><i>15/06/2021, 21:08:15</i></p><p class="from-gang">Will decrypt and upload asap.<br></br><i>15/06/2021, 21:16:53</i></p><p class="from-gang">esign_scripts-withTransID.sql [ 1kB ]<br></br><i>15/06/2021, 23:24:19</i></p><p class="from-gang">nopdf.csv [ 76kB ]<br></br><i>15/06/2021, 23:24:26</i></p><p class="from-victim">Powerpoint-france-[redacted]-destination.jpg.[redacted] [ 4.4MB ]<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 06:15:01</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thank you, can you decrypt this sample file as well please?<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 06:15:33</i></p><p class="from-victim">are you here ?<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 09:41:42</i></p><p class="from-gang">Powerpoint-france-[redacted]-destination.jpg [ 4.4MB ]<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 10:25:21</i></p><p class="from-victim">What will be the discount if we pay quickly to you today, we are working with banks and still struggling to get approvals as our financial records says we are already in loss because as you already know that we are an educational cultural exchange program that send student abroad to study, since start of covid till now we have not been able to sent applicants out of US in over a year which is same for other countries applicants<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 13:49:34</i></p><p class="from-gang">$500 000.

Please wait<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 16:10:07</i></p><p class="from-victim">We have collected around 100k from our partners and emergency funds and if the bank approves our loan ( which we are in constantly followup ) we will get additional 100K, so we will at position to pay you around 200k$ if all went as planned, but above that we are having no options to collect more funds.<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 16:12:28</i></p><p class="from-gang">Is this a joke? Do you understand that your business is in our hands? Do you understand the consequences for you if you do not agree with us?
We can't accept 200k.<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 16:22:54</i></p><p class="from-victim">We are not joking and know that you are a serious organization, as stated before the global pandemic effected our ability to operate for an entire year causing us to lose most of our business that keeps us floating. We are still working with the bank to try and convince them that their financial aid will not be wasted but they know about our current situation. We are pursuing additional means to finding more fundsand will update you on any progress we have made if any.<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 17:02:05</i></p><p class="from-victim">If you can give us another offer that might be more possible for us, it may help us convince the banks to approve a loan, we are still working on getting their assistance.<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 17:25:34</i></p><p class="from-gang">We are ready to go down to $480k from our side. That's a huge step forward keeping in mind that our initial claim was already pretty low comparing to our usual demands.<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 17:56:23</i></p><p class="from-victim">We should be able to secure the loan approval today which would give us the 200k once its put together, we are also currently working on an additional source that could potentially give us around $256,000 that we would then convert into BTC if the the process does not fall through. We know this is lower than what you are demanding but we just really do not have the type of financial ability to come up with that much.<br></br><i>16/06/2021, 18:37:42</i></p><p class="from-gang">We are ready to accept $256k.

Our recommendations will be :
1. Implement better email filtering policies
2. Implement tape-based backup hardware
3. Audit account access policies network wide
4. Rebuild the network using segmentation procedures
5. Implement better password policies
6. Block pass-the-hash and kerberoast attacks
7. Notify all your employees and security policies inside the company (opening email attachments, changing passwords, etc)
8.
