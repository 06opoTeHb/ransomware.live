Besides the encryption process we've downloaded a large pack of your internal documents and files that will be published in case our negotiations fail. How it happens can be seen on our website https://continews.best/ (TOR mirror: http://fylszpcqfel7joif.onion).
The recovery price is $8500000 (302.5 BTC). This initial offer is based on the details about your revenue and internal financial documents we currently have access to. If you want to make sure we can recover all of your data - you can send us the two files of your choice and we will decrypt them free of charge.
If we reach mutual agreement your will be provided with decryption tool, none of your internal data will be published, all the backdoors will be removed from your network and you will be provided with security tips on how to avoid further breaches.
We strongly recommend to review our offer in a timely manner to avoid additional expenses from your side on security software and on building the new network from scratch.<br></br><i>12/30/2020, 3:07:43 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: That's a crazy price.

There is really a lot of your data here<br></br><i>1/5/2021, 7:48:00 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: We certainly see that you have our data. Nothing to hide there<br></br><i>1/5/2021, 7:53:54 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: It's the price that's causing us heartburn...<br></br><i>1/5/2021, 7:54:11 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: Publishing data will cause customer churn and you will lose much more. It is more profitable to work with us<br></br><i>1/5/2021, 7:57:28 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: Yes, but how do we pay if we don't have the cash?<br></br><i>1/5/2021, 10:02:26 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: There are plenty of ways to get the cash, like insurance or a corporate loan.<br></br><i>1/6/2021, 7:48:31 AM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: If those were option we would have pulled those levers already!<br></br><i>1/6/2021, 7:53:21 AM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: We are ready to hear your proposal which is based on your abilities, but it should be relevant to the initial offer.<br></br><i>1/6/2021, 7:58:29 AM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: We are treating this as a data leak, no matter what. However, there is some upside to getting the files deleted (even though there are no assurances). Millions of dollars is excessive for this type of data and we don't have much need for a decryptor. Our proposal is $250,000.<br></br><i>1/6/2021, 7:22:39 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: That is way lower than your abilities and not as relevant to our expectations as we thought. Although I will pas your offer to my boss and get back to you.<br></br><i>1/6/2021, 7:48:08 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: Sounds good. Thanks.<br></br><i>1/7/2021, 7:46:05 AM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: We've discussed internally, and taking in consideration the facts that you are trying to work this through and the fact that you don't need the decryption tool I've managed to convince my boss to provide you the huge discount by going down to $2125000 (70% discount). If we close the deal this way we have to intention to sell or publish your data of course.<br></br><i>1/7/2021, 8:55:46 AM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: We are still far apart but we view this is a positive step. Thank you.<br></br><i>1/7/2021, 7:41:23 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: Can we discuss with our team?<br></br><i>1/7/2021, 7:41:34 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: yes<br></br><i>1/7/2021, 7:41:54 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: This reduction is interesting. It's almost end of week here and some of our management wants to discuss. Can we reach out next week?<br></br><i>1/8/2021, 1:41:55 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: Yes, sure, let's get back to this on Monday. Just keep us updated on the progress.<br></br><i>1/8/2021, 1:46:38 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: Ok<br></br><i>1/8/2021, 7:53:02 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: We're connecting on this topic later today and tomorrow morning. We may be able to increase the dollar amount.<br></br><i>1/11/2021, 6:15:35 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: Ok, will be waiting for further details<br></br><i>1/12/2021, 8:45:38 AM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: We have reviewed the data and while the files contain company information, they will not cause millions in damage. Even if they did, we'd have to live with that because we are on a tight budget in 2021. However, we think there is some value with your cooperation and we're prepared to pay $400,000 immediately. We can work out the details if you want to make a profit. Otherwise, we may be out of opportunities.<br></br><i>1/12/2021, 10:32:48 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: We will discuss internally and get back to you soon.<br></br><i>1/12/2021, 11:38:56 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: great, ok thank you.<br></br><i>1/13/2021, 8:13:13 AM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: We've discussed, despite the fact that my boss considers our last offer reasonable I managed to convince him to review it. He agreed to go down to $600k if the deal will be closed by the end of this week. Once the transfer is made you will be provided with security recommendations on network improvement, breach details, all you files will be completely wiped from our servers once and for all. 
Also we can upload your files to mega.nz secure share and provide you with full access to it. That's a fair offer and I did everything possible to make it work. Hope you appreciate.<br></br><i>1/13/2021, 10:58:09 AM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: We do appreciate that but we'll need to discuss since it's more money than what we have at the moment. Before we discuss, can you also confirm that we would receive a decryption tool in addition to the above deliverables?<br></br><i>1/13/2021, 6:24:56 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: As I remember you do not need a decryption tool. Am I mistaken? Most of the discount was provided based on the fact that you do not need the decryption.<br></br><i>1/13/2021, 8:08:47 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: There are some files that would save us time. $400,000 is not a small amount.<br></br><i>1/13/2021, 8:16:03 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: That is way below our offer. Yes, surely the decryptor would save you some time, and time means money. The $600k offer was for the data we hold. As you must understand we have some experience in negotiations, and you are trying to put us in the position that you think we accept, based on the basic information that is in the the press about usual sum we get. Relying on the press or public opinion is a mistake. About 75% of our deals are never leaked to the public or revealed. We will be waiting for your decision by tomorrow. $600k for the files or something better for full pack.<br></br><i>1/13/2021, 8:27:04 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: Yes, we know you are very experienced. We can sense it. All we're doing is seeing how much money we can spend, and $400,000 is an large sum. If we go down this path, then we certainly want all of the items that are available.<br></br><i>1/13/2021, 10:28:14 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: We've read about you in the press but we have no idea about the usual sum that you get. No one here wants to play games, and that's why we're trying to finalize the deliverables in advance. We want a solution and we assume you want to get paid. But $400,000 is only available if we can get everything. How else can we afford to pay that much?<br></br><i>1/13/2021, 10:30:33 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: The $400k is too low anyways. I will talk to my boss and try to get an offer for $600k that will contain the decryptor. Give me few hours.<br></br><i>1/14/2021, 5:24:58 AM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: Alright - your best offer that includes the decryptor will be taken under very serious consideration. Thank you.<br></br><i>1/14/2021, 7:58:23 AM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: Talked to my boss. When he heard about the decryption tool being needed, at first he was ready to move back to the previous offer or at least move to 1.2mil (x2 from the data offer), but we've decided not too be hard on you and are ready to stay at $750k. Take this to the management and let me know what they decide.<br></br><i>1/14/2021, 1:57:30 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: I appreciate you trying. We have a lot of money set aside for this but $750,000 just won't be possible. If the price was $600,000 then we may have been able to push closer to that. But at $750,000, it is just so far...<br></br><i>1/14/2021, 3:02:47 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: We can leave it $600k if the transfer will be done today or tomorrow.

This is still above our budget but we can try to work towards it quickly. Thanks.<br></br><i>1/14/2021, 3:10:31 PM</i></p><p class="from-victim">[redacted]: We took this management and discussed. They were certainly appreciative of you being able to include the decryptor in the $600,000 price. While the price itself is still high for us, we feel more confident in being able to move past this with you. We may be paying more than the value, but want to keep the positivity in our discussions. As a result, we can increase our offer to $450,000 and can begin the transfer soon if you are with us. Thank you.<br></br><i>1/14/2021, 10:51:32 PM</i></p><p class="from-gang">Support: $600k.
