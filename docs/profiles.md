## **ako**

> A Windows ransomware that will run certain tasks to prepare the target system for the encryption of files. MedusaLocker avoids executable files, probably to avoid rendering the targeted system unusable for paying the ransom. It uses a combination of AES and RSA-2048, and reportedly appends extensions such as .encrypted, .bomber, .boroff, .breakingbad, .locker16, .newlock, .nlocker, and .skynet.

## **alphv**

> ALPHV, also known as BlackCat or Noberus, is a ransomware family that is deployed as part of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operations. ALPHV is written in the Rust programming language and supports execution on Windows, Linux-based operating systems (Debian, Ubuntu, ReadyNAS, Synology), and VMWare ESXi. ALPHV is marketed as ALPHV on cybercrime forums, but is commonly called BlackCat by security researchers due to an icon of a black cat appearing on its leak site. ALPHV has been observed being deployed in ransomware attacks since November 18, 2021.ALPHV can be configured to encrypt files using either the AES or ChaCha20 algorithms. In order to maximize the amount of ransomed data, ALPHV can delete volume shadow copies, stop processes and services, and stop virtual machines on ESXi servers. ALPHV can self-propagate by using PsExec to remote execute itself on other hosts on the local network.

> Clop is a ransomware which uses the .clop extension after having encrypted the victim's files. Another unique characteristic belonging with Clop is in the string: "Dont Worry C|0P" included into the ransom notes. It is a variant of CryptoMix ransomware, but it additionally attempts to disable Windows Defender and to remove the Microsoft Security Essentials in order to avoid user space detection.

## **conti**

> Conti is an extremely damaging ransomware due to the speed with which it encrypts data and spreads to other systems. It was first observed in 2020 and it is thought to be led by a Russia-based cybercrime group that goes under the Wizard Spider pseudonym. In early May 2022, the US government announced a reward of up to $10 million for information on the Conti ransomware gang.

Seglarstaden och badorten Marstrand är inte utan anledning en storfavorit för alla besökare. Här finns kajen med båtar av alla slag, mysiga hus vid bilfria gator, topprestauranger och caféer, sol och salta bad, musik och skådespel. På toppen av ön tronar Carlstens fästning. Efter en kort färjetur över sundet befinner du dig på själva Marstrandsön, med en levande närvaro från en svunnen tid, blandat med trendiga seglarjackor. På Marstrand finner man både krogliv och stilla lugn beroende på när man besöker ön. Med sina mysiga kvarter, små gränder och prång, sin dominerande fästning och havsutsikt vart man än vänder sig, väcker ön starka känslor. Längs bryggorna i Sveriges största gästhamn ligger båtarna tätt och med GKSS Match Cup Sweden första veckan i juli är Marstrand definitivt seglingens huvudstad i Sverige. | <a href="https://images.ransomware.live/screenshots/posts/e4268348ff38e917668800ba0900b0fb.png" target=_blank>📸</a> |

## **ech0raix**

> The QNAPCrypt ransomware works similarly to other ransomware, including encrypting all files and delivering a ransom note. However, there are several important differences:1. The ransom note was included solely as a text file, without any message on the screen—naturally, because it is a server and not an endpoint.2. Every victim is provided with a different, unique Bitcoin wallet—this could help the attackers avoid being traced.3. Once a victim is compromised, the malware requests a wallet address and a public RSA key from the command and control server (C&C) before file encryption.

## **exorcist**

> According to PCrisk, Exorcist is a ransomware-type malicious program. Systems infected with this malware experience data encryption and users receive ransom demands for decryption. During the encryption process, all compromised files are appended with an extension consisting of a ransom string of characters.For example, a file originally named "1.jpg" could appear as something similar to "1.jpg.rnyZoV" following encryption. After this process is complete, Exorcist ransomware changes the desktop wallpaper and drops HTML applications - "[random-string]-decrypt.hta" (e.g. "rnyZoV-decrypt.hta") - into affected folders. These files contain identical ransom messages.

## **hellokitty**

> Unit42 states that HelloKitty is a ransomware family that first surfaced at the end of 2020, primarily targeting Windows systems. The malware family got its name due to its use of a Mutex with the same name: HelloKittyMutex. The ransomware samples seem to evolve quickly and frequently, with different versions making use of the .crypted or .kitty file extensions for encrypted files. Some newer samples make use of a Golang packer that ensures the final ransomware code is only loaded in memory, most likely to evade detection by security solutions.

## **lorenz**

> Tesorion describes Lorenz as a ransomware with design and implementation flaws, leading to impossible decryption with tools provided by the attackers. A free decryptor for 2021 versions was made available via the NoMoreRansom initiative. A new version of the malware was discovered in March 2022, for which again was provided a free decryptor, while the ransomware operators are not able to provide tools to decrypt affected files.

## **prolock**

> PwndLocker is a ransomware that was observed in late 2019 and is reported to have been used to target businesses and local governments/cities. According to one source, ransom amounts demanded as part of PwndLocker activity range from $175k USD to $650k USD depending on the size of the network. PwndLocker attempts to disable a variety of Windows services so that their data can be encrypted. Various processes will also be targeted, such as web browsers and software related to security, backups, and databases. Shadow copies are cleared by the ransomware, and encryption of files occurs once the system has been prepared in this way. Executable files and those that are likely to be important for the system to continue to function appear to be skipped by the ransomware, and a large number of folders mostly related to Microsoft Windows system files are also ignored. As of March 2020, encrypted files have been observed with the added extensions of .key and .pwnd. Ransom notes are dropped in folders where encrypted files are found and also on the user's desktop.

## **qilin**

> PYSA ransomware group operates as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model. PYSA stands for “Protect Your System Amigo”, The PYSA ransomware malware is a variant of the Mespinoza ransomware. It was first seen within open-source documents in December 2019, two months after Mespinoza ransomware was spotted in the wild. PYSA affiliates can customize their malware based on options provided by the RaaS platform, and deploy it as customized. PYSA usually exfiltrates data from its victims before encrypting the files to be ransomed.

## **ranzy**

> Ranzy Locker, Former known as ThunderX. The group hosting a data leak site in the darknet where they posting sensitive information of victims who do not pay the ransom. ThunderX was launched at the end of August 2020. Soon after launching, weaknesses were found in the code, that allowed decrypting the files that the malware encrypted. The group has fixed the code and publish a new version, then released it under the name Ranzy Locker. The Tor onion URL used by the Ranzy Leak site is the same as the one used by Ako Ransomware. The use of the same URL could indicate that both groups merged, or they are cooperating similarly to the Maze cartel.

## **revil**

> Sodinokibi ransomware group also known as REvil (Ransomware Evil) operates as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model. After the group compromised his victims, they would threaten to publish the victim's sensitive data on their darknet blog named 'Happy Blog', unless the ransom is paid. The ransomware malware code used by REvil is pretty similar to the ransomware code used by DarkSide - a different threat actor. REvil group claims to steal information after a successful attack on the supplier of the tech giant Apple and stole confidential schematics of their upcoming products.

It also modifies filenames and creates a text file/ransom note (HowToRestoreYourFiles.txt). Rook renames files by appending the .Rook extension. For example, it renames 1.jpg to 1.jpg.Rook, 2.jpg to 2.jpg.Rook.

| [`Colrich`](http://www.colrich.com) | 26/05/2023 | From South Africa to Southern California, the ColRich story is a decades-long journey of growth, continuous reinvention and a culture of caring.Through generations of family ownership, the ColRich brand has evolved, but the company’s foundation remains the same today as in the beginning – build lasting communities through a culture centered around innovation, humility, perseverance, and a commitment to helping others.In 1977, business colleagues and friends Richard Gabriel, Barry Galgut and Colin Seid moved from Johannesburg to San Diego, leaving the unrest of apartheid-era South Africa for a more stable environment to raise their families. The trio quickly formed a San Diego-based partnership to pursue development and investment opportunities in Southern California. The business achieved notable success over more than two decades – largely due to continual reinvention and the team’s ability to leverage the peaks and troughs of the cyclical real estate industry.Gabriel’s sons, Graeme and Danny, took the helm in 2003 to build the next iteration of ColRich, creating a diverse residential platform that leverages a unique homebuilding background, renovation expertise, sophisticated in-house construction and design teams brought together in private capital partnerships. Today, ColRich is recognized as an industry leader for integrating design and value into both for-sale and multifamily rental properties.Total downloaded data  -  560gb | <a href="https://images.ransomware.live/screenshots/posts/8effb79e05035290e33be79d1df63dc8.png" target=_blank>📸</a> |

## **snatch**

> Snatch is a ransomware which infects victims by rebooting the PC into Safe Mode. Most of the existing security protections do not run in Safe Mode so that it the malware can act without expected countermeasures and it can encrypt as many files as it finds. It uses common packers such as UPX to hide its payload.

## **wannacry**

> WannaCry ransomware is a cyber attack that spreads by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system. At its peak in May 2017, WannaCry became a global threat. Cybercriminals used the ransomware to hold an organization's data hostage and extort money in the form of cryptocurrency. WannaCry spreads using EternalBlue, an exploit leaked from the National Security Agency (NSA). EternalBlue enables attackers to use a zero-day vulnerability to gain access to a system. It targets Windows computers that use a legacy version of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.
