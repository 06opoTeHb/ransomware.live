Our CEO Bill McGivern and Executive Vice President Keith Schatko first met while playing little league together. Years later, as fate would have it, both Schatko and McGivern were working at what was then known as Macomb Pipe & Supply to help pay for college tuition. Although they knew they wanted to become business owners, they also knew how important warehouse operations were to the success of a company so they learned all they could. They started by sweeping floors, packing orders, familiarizing themselves with the products and working the sales counter. When the time came, McGivern and Schatko, together with then-partner Doug Howe purchased the company.SITE: https://www.macombgroup.com Address 6600 East 15 Mile RoadSterling Heights, MI 48312Phone: (586) 274-4100Fax: (586) 274-4125 |   |
