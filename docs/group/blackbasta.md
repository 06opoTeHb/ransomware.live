It all started when the president of Broward Factory Service/ BFS Home Warranty, Crockett Herd, was working as an electrician from 9-5 and taking advantage of any overtime opportunities he was offered to support his family. It was at this time, in 1973 that Mr. Herd had the idea of branching out and providing complete household services to families in the Broward County area. Mr. Herd approached condominiums and homeowners associations with this idea and with his hard work, evident integrity, and passion for helping families, BFS was born. Over the past forty plus years BFS has grown to service 4 states, with 18 local service centers. Integrity- doing the right thing, even when no one is looking. This is the whole premise that BFS was born and has grown upon. One of Mr. Herd‚Äôs favorite sayings is ‚ÄúAlways treat your customers as you would want your mother to be treated,‚Äù and this is what our customer service representatives strive to do each and every day. Our mission here at BFS is to keep your family comfortable by providing exceptional service through integrity, hard work, and treating our customers like family. With Crockett Herd still at the helm, two subsequent generations on board, and a close-knit workforce of 200 plus employees, family is still the core of this company today. We look forward to the opportunity to make your family a priority, while providing you with complete indoor comfort by taking care of all of your HVAC and household appliance needs.SITE: www.browardfactory.com Address : 3500 N. 28th Terrace Hollywood, FL 33020 (800) 237-9910 | <a href="https://images.ransomware.live/screenshots/posts/7c2779155aaa3b468bb10523359b1a1e.png" target=_blank>üì∏</a> |
