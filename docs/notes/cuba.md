Good day. All your files are encrypted. For decryption contact us.
Write here roselondon@cock.li
reserve admin@cuba-supp.com
jabber cuba_support@exploit.im
We also inform that your databases, ftp server and file server were downloaded by us to our servers.
If we do not receive a message from you within three days, we regard this as a refusal to negotiate.
Check our platform: http://cuba4ikm4jakjgmkezytyawtdgr2xymvy6nvzgw5cglswg3si76icnqd.onion/
* Do not rename encrypted files.
* Do not try to decrypt your data using third party software,
it may cause permanent data loss.
* Do not stop process of encryption, because partial encryption cannot be decrypted.
