Your files was encrypted by "Money message" profitable organization  and can't be accessed anymore.

If you pay ransom, you will get a decryptor to decrypt them. Don't try to decrypt files yourself - in that case they will be damaged and unrecoverable.

For further negotiations open this clientcuworpelkdwecucgvfhp5uz5n7uohsnokndrlhm2zkntyg3had.onion/chat.php?chatId=[snip]
using tor browser https://www.torproject.org/download/

In case you refuse to pay, we will post the files we stole from your internal network, in our blog:

Encrypted files can't be decrypted without our decryption software.
